allocating KSM at the start from moonriver causes error
Need to dynamically allocate KSM to kusama, from multiple chains until reach sufficient amount

Currently removed sql/mongo logging from powershell script. Need to update them and re implement

USDCet -> KUSD stable swap algo not correctly pricing. like expecting 24.43 usdcet -> 31.94 kusd, but failing for min swap amount. worked successfull for 31.65 out. Just temp decrease price percent on stable swap?


FIgure this out, think i ran from last node, after i executed a new arb that consolidated all KSM and then failed.

Change search to try until it fails from the same node twice in a row.
Then have fallback search get a new route without the node that is not crossable
